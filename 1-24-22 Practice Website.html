					<h5 class="card-title">My Hobbies</h5>
					<p class="card-text">My primary hobby like many other CS majors is videogames. I also like board games like chess which I am taking a class about this semester. Another interest of mine is music both playing and listening. I used to play clarinet and started learning piano, and I want to learn bass. When I listen to music it's usually Pop-Rap or Rock. A recent interest of mine has been going to the gym with some friends.</p>
